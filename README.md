# Oblyon
Oblyon free theme for Dolibarr ERP & CRM

## Installation

This theme is actually composed of two things:
* a "_regular_" Dolibarr theme (stored in `htdocs/theme`)
* a custom Dolibarr module (stored in `htdocs/custom`)

To install Oblyon, you must copy the content of the `htdocs` folder into your Dolibarr `htdocs` folder.
Make sure to install the branch appropraite for your Dolibarr version.

## How to use

To use the theme, you **must** activate the module. When activating the module, the theme will automatically be activated as well.

**Activating the theme alone will result in unexpected behaviors!**
